# Falcon-Logistics-Optimization

This repository contains the analysis, visualizations, and strategic recommendations for optimizing Falcon Hustlers' logistics operations. The project leverages operational data to enhance route planning, fleet management, and warehouse efficiency across multiple key cities.

# Project Overview
The Falcon Logistics Optimization Project was developed to address operational delays, high fuel costs, and warehouse inefficiencies across various urban centers. By analyzing performance metrics and operational data, the project identifies key areas for improvement:

Location Strategy: Recommending regional hubs in high-demand cities.

Fleet Management: Optimizing vehicle allocation based on traffic, distance, and load capacity utilization.

# Key Features
Data-Driven Analysis: Uses detailed metrics to pinpoint inefficiencies in regional operations.

Strategic Hub Location: Identifies cities with high demand and delays (e.g., Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Pune) for establishing regional hubs.

Optimized Fleet Allocation: Recommends specific vehicle types (vans, trucks, mini-trucks) based on route conditions and operational needs.

# Location Strategy Analysis
The analysis evaluates the performance of cities by comparing average delivery delays and fuel costs:

High-Demand Cities: Identified cities such as Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Pune for potential regional hubs given their demand and service delays.

Cost Efficiency: Pinpoints cities like Kolkata, Jaipur, and Pune as candidates for hub-based delivery due to higher fuel cost per kilometer, suggesting localized improvements to enhance overall efficiency.

# Fleet Management Recommendations
Fleet optimization is achieved by assessing:

Traffic Conditions: Tailoring vehicle assignments based on expected traffic delays.

Distance Covered: Prioritizing fleet types that maximize fuel efficiency over longer routes.

Load Capacity Utilization: Matching vehicle types with the nature of goods and route requirements.

Examples:

Ahmedabad & Chennai: Recommendation to use vans.

Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune: Preference for trucks.

Kolkata & Surat: Assigning mini-trucks where applicable.

# Technologies Used
Data Analysis Tools: Python(pandas,matplotlib,seaborn), Excel.

Data Visualization: Power BI
